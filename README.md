The goal of this project was to facilitate the moderation of Discord servers by providing a dedicated client for bot management and moderation tasks.

## Project Benefits
This project is useful for server administrators who need an efficient and user-friendly way to manage bots and perform moderation tasks on Discord servers.

## Project Description
This tool provides a client interface for managing Discord bots and performing moderation tasks. It integrates with the backend project [api.discord-bot](https://github.com/Fulldroper/api.discord-bot) for handling API requests and bot commands.

## Repository Link and Installation Example
Repository: [Discord Bot Administrator](https://github.com/Fulldroper/discord.bot-administrator)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fulldroper/discord.bot-administrator
cd discord.bot-administrator
npm install
```

### Usage
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the client interface via the local server URL provided in the terminal output.

## Project Workflow
1. **User Authentication**: Users log in to the client interface using their Discord credentials.
    ```javascript
    // Example of user authentication
    async function login() {
        const response = await fetch('/api/login', { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include' });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (data.success) {
            // User is logged in
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Bot Management**: Users can add, remove, and configure bots for their Discord servers.
    ```javascript
    // Example of adding a bot
    async function addBot(botDetails) {
        const response = await fetch('/api/add-bot', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(botDetails)
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (data.success) {
            // Bot added successfully
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Moderation Tasks**: Users can perform various moderation tasks such as muting, banning users, and managing roles.
    ```javascript
    // Example of muting a user
    async function muteUser(userId) {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/mute/${userId}`, { method: 'POST' });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (data.success) {
            // User muted successfully
        }
    }
    ```
